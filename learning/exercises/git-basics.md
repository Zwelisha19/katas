**Exercise: Git Adventure**

Welcome to the Git Adventure exercise! This hands-on task will help you practice your understanding of Git. If you're new to Git, don't worry. You can watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE) to get an overview of what Git is.

For a more detailed explanation, you can also check out [this read me](https://github.com/midastouchtech/katas/blob/main/learning/git/what-is-git.md) that explains the key concepts of Git.

Now, let's dive into the exercise!

1. **Setup:**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub (you can call it "GitAdventure").
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Task 1: Initial Commit**
   - Create a new file named `introduction.txt`.
   - Add a brief introduction about yourself in the file.
   - Stage and commit the changes.

3. **Task 2: Branching**
   - Create a new branch named `feature/add-info`.
   - Switch to the new branch.
   - Add more information to the `introduction.txt` file.
   - Stage and commit the changes.

4. **Task 3: Another Branch**
   - Create another branch named `feature/add-photo`.
   - Switch to the new branch.
   - Add a photo file (you can use any image) to the repository.
   - Stage and commit the changes.

5. **Task 4: Merging**
   - Switch back to the `main` branch.
   - Merge the `feature/add-info` branch into `main`.
   - Check if the introduction information has been updated.
   - Merge the `feature/add-photo` branch into `main`.
   - Check if the photo file has been added.

6. **Task 5: Pushing to GitHub**
   - Push all your changes and branches to the GitHub repository.
   - Verify that the changes and branches are visible on the GitHub repository page.

**Guidelines:**

- Refer to the provided video for a quick overview of Git.
- For a detailed explanation, explore the README on Git concepts.
- Use appropriate commit messages that describe what changes you made.
- Don't hesitate to refer to the Git commands mentioned in the previous README as a reference.

**Outcome:**

By completing this exercise, you'll have practiced creating branches, making changes, and merging branches in a controlled environment. You'll also have pushed your changes to GitHub, reinforcing the entire process.

Enjoy the adventure and happy coding!
